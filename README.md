This problem deals with reachability on a fixed-size grid.  Given a starting location and an ending location, it asks if it's possible to move from the start to the end in a specific number of steps, considering the following constraints:

Movement is only allowed between neighboring cells that share a side.
The total number of allowed steps is fixed.
The solution involves checking if the ending location is reachable within the given step limit based on the allowed movement pattern.
